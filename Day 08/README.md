# Day 8 Fun With HTML5 Canvas

Super fun assignment. I've never used Canvas before. I decided to randomize everything for the fun of it, every time you draw, something about it will be different.  
I was thinking about putting sliders to fully make it customizable, but i liked the randomness so i kept it. Every drawing looks like an abstact art! 🖌️🎨🖼️
