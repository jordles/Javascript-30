# Day 18 Adding Up Times with Reduce 

I randomized the number of videos to display and gave it a theatre theme. 🎞️🎬 All the screening times are also randomized and return the total of all screening time at the very bottom.  
Since were doing a conversion with 60, everything is randomized up to the number 60 to stay on theme.
