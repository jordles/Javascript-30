# Day 19 Webcam Fun

I spent a bit more time on this assignment. I made it look more like a photobooth visually, including its features.   
There will be future improvements made at a later time**  

Pick 3 photos from the ones you've taken, and you can 'print' out your photos! ðŸ“¸

* MediaDevices - we grabbed our media device and placed it into our media elements on the DOM. 
* HTMLMediaElement - With various properties we can display our media devices onto our media elements on the DOM.
