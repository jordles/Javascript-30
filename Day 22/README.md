# Day 22 Follow Along Link Highlighter

Since the lesson included a rainbow background, I went for an artsy theme. 🎨🖌️   
The highlight is a brush stroke, and I changed the text color so its transparent and you can see the background underneath it.

## Key Topics
* HTMLElements - grab the boundingClient of our element, and apply the length properties to our highlight element so, its always stays the same size as our highlighted word. 
* Transition - We can transition our highlight element so it looks like its moving around.
