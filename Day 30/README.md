# Day 30 Pop the Pimple! (Whack a Mole)

As someone who still has frequent acne through adulthood, i decided on a pimple theme, because the concept was fun and exciting to me.  
I added different difficulties, including enflamed pimples, which require two clicks(pinches) to pop. The cursor is a hand pinching.
The hard mode has 50% of spawning an enflamed pimple. 

** Note: please do not pop your pimples, it will cause scarring. **

## Key Topics
* I used a lot of concepts we've learned over this challenge course: event listeners, built-in objects like Math that allows us to randomize data through the random method, scopes, flags, counters, traversing and targeting elements in the DOM.
