# Javascript 30 Coding Challenge (Ongoing)
This is my take on the [#Javascript30](https://javascript30.com/) Coding Challenge by [Wesbos](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30), Day 4 challenge was a part of the [100Devs](https://leonnoel.com/100devs/) learning course, so I decided to do the whole challenge!
